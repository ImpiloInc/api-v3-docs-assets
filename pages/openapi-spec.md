This website is constructed based on Impilo's OpenAPI specification, providing a standardized and user-friendly interface to interact with our APIs. For those interested in the technical details or looking to access the raw OpenAPI specification, please visit the links below. There, you'll find the foundational schema that outlines the structure, parameters, and responses of our API endpoints, facilitating deeper understanding and code generation.

> **Note:**  
> If using our staging environment, be sure to use the staging endpoint.  
> For example, the `baseUrl` field in the Postman Collection should be changed to `https://staging.impiloplatform.com` when using the staging environment.
